# Variables and Types

In Python, variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable.

## Numbers

Python supports different types of numbers:

- Integers (whole numbers)
- Floating point (decimals)

You can assign numbers directly:

```python
myint = 20
myfloat = 10.0
